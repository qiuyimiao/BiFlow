They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace. The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers. They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies. And death was an everyday matter to them.",

I have beautiful pears myself, and I\ninvite you all to eat them with me.\" Then some one asked: \"If you have\npears then why do you not eat your own?\" He answered: \"I first must\nhave a seed to plant.\" And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto.

The prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her, for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment, and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her, and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself. At length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians; he did not tell her what he was going to do, lest it should make her worse, but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king's person to follow him to the princess's apartments. Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: 'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain. He then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness, but not a word would she say.",

He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast.\r\r'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy. The very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter's tongue, which would break the dove's spell, if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea; if not, then it would be useless. The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink, and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again; but, to make all quite safe, the old woman might bewitch the girl; and so she did. After that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible, and made her way straight into her daughter's room. 'I have got it! I have got it!' she cried triumphantly, and laid the ointment on her daughter's tongue.\n\n'Now what do you say?' she asked proudly.\n\n'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' answered the daughter; and the mother wrung her hands and wept, as she knew that all her plans had failed.\n\nAt this moment the prince entered with his real wife. 'You both deserved death,' he said, 'and if it were left to me, you should have it. But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay till you die.'\n\nThen the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it, and it sailed away, and no more was heard of them.

Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.'\r\rBy long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe. 'That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.'\n\n'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another.\n\n'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third.\n\n'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first. And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen.\n\nThe father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy. 'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.\n\n'That is our secret,' said the doves.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. 'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.\n\n'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.\n\nThen the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. 'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

Then\nshe took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off\nher fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that\nher beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were\ncoming out of a black cloud. Then she opened the nut, and took out the\ndress as golden as the sun. And when she had done this, she went up to\nthe feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and\nthey thought she must be a King's daughter. But the King came towards\nher and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My\neyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' When the dance was ended, she\ncurtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared,\nno one knew whither. The guards who were standing before the palace were\ncalled and questioned, but no one had seen her. When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she\nwas. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,\n'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots\nthrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he\nasked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King\ncould find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.\n\nAfter a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature\nbegged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He\nanswered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King\nthe bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little\nroom, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver\nas the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a\nKing's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her\nagain, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",

He rules over all fish and animals of the deep;\rhe has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass\rat the bottom of the ocean.

Ahti owns also the fairest\rmaidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of\rmusic they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.'\r\r'Oh!' cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?'\r\r'We have as good as seen it,' said the students. 'It is all printed in a\rbook, and everything printed is true.'\r\r'I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head.",

He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich\rman, but one must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changeful\rand touchy. Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him,\rand then as he takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a storm\rand drags the sailors down into the depths. Ahti owns also the fairest\rmaidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of\rmusic they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.'\r\r'Oh!' cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?'\r\r'We have as good as seen it,' said the students. 'It is all printed in a\rbook, and everything printed is true.'\r\r'I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head. But the herring were now ready, and the students ate enough for six,\rand gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat.\rPrince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat.\rWhen all was finished, the students handed Matte a shining silver coin,\rand allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco. They\rthen thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey,\rmuch regretted by Prince, who sat with a woeful expression and whined on\rthe shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat's white sail in the\rdistance.\r\rMaie had never uttered a word, but thought the more. She had good ears,\rand had laid to heart the story about Ahti. 'How delightful,' thought\rshe to herself, 'to possess a fairy cow! How delicious every morning and\revening to draw milk from it, and yet have no trouble about the feeding,\rand to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets!
