'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.\n\n'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.\n\nThen the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. 'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.\r\rThe King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven fairies. The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend.",

One day when she had grown up,\nher father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother,\nso he said to his councillors, 'I will marry my daughter to one of you,\nand she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and\nwhen I die her husband shall be king.' But when the Princess heard of\nher father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him,\n'Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; one as golden as\nthe sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars. Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of\nskin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.'\nBut she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall\nnot have to marry someone I do not care for.' The King, however, was not\nto be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens\nin his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and\none as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave\norders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the\nkingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand\npieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak\nto be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and\nsaid, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw\nthat there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she\ndetermined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping,\nshe got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a\nlittle gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and\nstar dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made\nher face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God,\nand went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large\nforest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree\nand fell asleep.",
