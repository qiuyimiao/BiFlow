    "context": "At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. Those who came first were the saints of the sword. They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace. The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers. They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies. And death was an everyday matter to them.",

Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: 'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain.

He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast.\r\r'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy. The very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter's tongue, which would break the dove's spell, if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea; if not, then it would be useless. The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink, and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again; but, to make all quite safe, the old woman might bewitch the girl; and so she did. After that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible, and made her way straight into her daughter's room. 'I have got it! I have got it!' she cried triumphantly, and laid the ointment on her daughter's tongue.\n\n'Now what do you say?' she asked proudly.\n\n'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' answered the daughter; and the mother wrung her hands and wept, as she knew that all her plans had failed.\n\nAt this moment the prince entered with his real wife. 'You both deserved death,' he said, 'and if it were left to me, you should have it. But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay till you die.'\n\nThen the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it, and it sailed away, and no more was heard of them.

Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.'\r\rBy long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe. 'That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.'\n\n'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another.\n\n'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third.\n\n'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first. And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen.\n\nThe father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy. 'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.\n\n'That is our secret,' said the doves.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. 'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.\n\n'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.\n\nThen the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. 'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast.\r\r'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy.",

The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity.\n\nOne day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst.\n\nWhen he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him 'Good-morning,' and said: 'Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine-I am so hungry and thirsty.' But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way;' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest. There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up.\n\nThen the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother. He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine.\n\nBut the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of. Just go your own way, will you?' Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home.",

They made a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two children.",

He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. I know he can tell you.' And so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man. He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; but this time the old man answered, 'The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep. For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.'\n\nSo the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows. He opened the big gate leading into the courtyard, and was just going to walk in, when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted?",

To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch. The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there.\n\n'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness.'",

The King, however, was not\nto be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens\nin his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and\none as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave\norders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the\nkingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand\npieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak\nto be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and\nsaid, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw\nthat there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she\ndetermined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping,\nshe got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a\nlittle gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and\nstar dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made\nher face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God,\nand went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large\nforest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree\nand fell asleep.",

There they showed her a tiny room under\nthe stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred\nCreature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the\nkitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed\nvegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty\nwork.\n\nSo the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty. Ah,\nbeautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now?",

Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of\nskin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.'\nBut she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall\nnot have to marry someone I do not care for.' The King, however, was not\nto be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens\nin his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and\none as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave\norders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the\nkingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand\npieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak\nto be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and\nsaid, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw\nthat there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she\ndetermined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping,\nshe got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a\nlittle gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and\nstar dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made\nher face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God,\nand went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large\nforest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree\nand fell asleep.",

When the King found the reel at the bottom, he had the\nMany-furred Creature brought to him, and then he saw the white finger,\nand the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance. Then he took her\nhand and held her tightly, and as she was trying to get away, she undid\nthe fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out. The King seized\nthe cloak and tore it off her. Her golden hair came down, and she stood\nthere in her full splendour, and could not hide herself away any more.\nAnd when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked\nmore beautiful than anyone in the world. But the King said, 'You are\nmy dear bride, and we will never be separated from one another.' So the\nwedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.",

The Happy Hunter knew all this full well, but he could say nothing, for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience; so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook. He was much cast down, for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother's hook now. While he stood on the beach, lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next, an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand. The Happy Hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came, neither did he know how he was there-he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him. As soon as the crocodile landed him, the Happy Hunter hastened to tell the Skillful Fisher of his safe return. He then gave him back the fishing hook which had been found in the mouth of the TAI and which had been the cause of so much trouble between them. He earnestly begged his brother's forgiveness, telling him all that had happened to him in the Sea King's Palace and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the hook.",

    "context": "\"Well,\" said the chief steward, \"if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!\"\n\n\"How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it,\" said the perplexed jelly fish.\n\n\"This is what you must do,\" said the wily chief steward. \"When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!\"\n\n\"But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?\" said the reluctant jelly fish.\n\n\"You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!\" said the chief steward.\n\n\"Won't he be very heavy?\" queried kurage again.\n\n\"You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King,\" replied the chief steward.\n\n\"I will do my best then,\" said the jelly fish, and he swam away from the Palace and started off towards the Monkey Island. Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for-a live monkey. \"I have got him at last!\" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said:\n\n\"Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you-a land-lubber.\"\n\n\"I should love to go,\" said the monkey, \"but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as you surely know!\"\n\n\"There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back.\"\n\n\"That will be troubling you too much,\" said the monkey.\n\n\"I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,\" said the jelly fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.\n\n\"Keep very still, Mr. monkey,\" said the jelly fish. \"You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's Palace.\"\n\n\"Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,\" said the monkey.",

When they reached the deepest part of the water, she began\rto hum the words of the magic rhyme, altering the words to suit the\rlonging of her heart:\r\r          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,\r               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,\r          Finest treasures have I heard,\r               And glittering fish belong to thee.\r          The richest pearls beyond compare,\r               Are stored up in thy realm below,\r          And Ocean's cows so sleek and fair,\r               Feed on the grass in thy green meadow.\r\r          King of the waters, far and near,\r               I ask not of thy golden store,\r          I wish not jewels of pearl to wear,\r               Nor silver either, ask I for,\r          But one is odd and even is two,\r               So give me a cow, sea-king so bold,\r          And in return I'll give to you,\r               A slice of the moon, and the sun's gold.\r\r'What's that you're humming?' asked the old man. 'Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,'\ranswered the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on:\r\r          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,\r               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,\r          A thousand cows are in thy herd,\r               I pray thee give one onto me.\r\r'That's a stupid sort of song,' said Matte. 'What else should one beg of\rthe sea-king but fish? But such songs are not for Sunday.'\r\rHis wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all\rthe time they were on the water. Matte heard nothing more as he sat and\rrowed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine\rtobacco. Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed.\r\rBut neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; the one thought of how he\rhad profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti's cow.",

She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great\rabundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition. Every one\rPrince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; but Prince barked\rat her, for he had now got a rival.\r\rFrom that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and every\rnet was filled with fish. Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living,\rand daily became richer. She churned quantities of butter, and he hired\rtwo men to help him in his fishing. The sea lay before him like a big\rfish tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; and the cow\rcontinued to fend for herself. In autumn, when Matte and Maie went\rashore, the cow went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to the\rrock, there she stood awaiting them.",

'Whence comes this gust of wind?' said Maie; and as she spoke the sea\ropened and swallowed up the steamer. Maie sank to the bottom like a\rstone, but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface,\rwhere she found the fiddler's fiddle, and used it as a float. At the\rsame moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and he\rhad only half a beard!\r\r'Why did you throw stones at me?' roared the sea-king.\r\r'Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! Put some bear's grease on your\rbeard and that will soon make it grow again.'\r\r'Dame, did I not give you all you asked for--nay, even more?'\r\r'Truly, truly, your majesty.

There Prince lay, as famished as ever, gnawing the carcase of\ra crow. There sat Matte in his ragged grey jacket, quite alone, on the\rsteps of the old hut, mending a net.",

But you are a dunderhead and\nwill stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you\nany longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living.\"",

He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with,\nand he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are,\nas a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with\nthese attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high\nspirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might\nbe, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star.\nWhen the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face\ntill the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a\nlucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his\nboat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him\nhanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and\nasked him how he felt, he would reply: \"O, quite well. I have been\nsaved. I surely am in luck!\" But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to\nremain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone;\nand he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point\nof the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a\nsea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still\nprovisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other\nthings. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. \"He will come back\nthis evening,\" said he. \"Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.\"\nBut in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited\nday by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his\nbrother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to\nkeep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And\nsuch was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his\nhomeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew\nhad been drowned.",

So he chose the youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with her in peace and happiness.\n\nBut at last he was minded to travel home, and see how his parents fared.\nThis did not suit his queen; but since he wanted to go so badly, and\nfinally was on the point of departure, she said to him: \"One thing you\nmust promise me, that you will only do what your father tells you to do,\nbut not what your mother tells you to do.\" And this he promised. Then\nshe gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the\none who wore it. So he wished himself home, and his parents could not\nget over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become. When he had been home a few days, his mother wanted him to go up to the\ncastle and show the king what a man he had grown to be. His father said:\n\"No, he had better not do that, for we will have to do without him in\nthe meantime.\" But there was no help for it, the mother begged and\npleaded until he went. When he got there he was more splendidly dressed\nand fitted out than the other king. This did not suit the latter, and he\nsaid: \"You can see what my queen looks like, but I cannot see yours; and\nI do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine.\" \"God grant she were\nstanding here, then you would see soon enough!\" said the young king, and\nthere she stood that very minute. But she was very sad, and said to him:\n\"Why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father? Now I must\ngo straight home, and you have used up both of your wishes.\" With that\nshe bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself\nhome.",
