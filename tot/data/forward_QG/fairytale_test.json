    "context": "At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. Those who came first were the saints of the sword. They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace. The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers. They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies. And death was an everyday matter to them.",

Three times he went away and returned until he had finished. Then he took his master and Rose-Red upon his back, and flew away with them over the steep walls. None of the watchmen of the prince's palace noticed anything out of the way. At home the youth hid Rose-Red in a distant room.\n\nWhen the prince discovered that one of his slave-girls was missing, and that one of his wild dogs had been killed, he said: \"That must have been some powerful sword hero!\" And he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned, and that investigations should be made in secret.",

Crash, crash! so it went\nfor a while, and the tree was felled. Then he took the tree on his\nshoulder and walked away at an easy gait.",

But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy. The very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter's tongue, which would break the dove's spell, if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea; if not, then it would be useless. The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink, and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again; but, to make all quite safe, the old woman might bewitch the girl; and so she did. After that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible, and made her way straight into her daughter's room. 'I have got it! I have got it!' she cried triumphantly, and laid the ointment on her daughter's tongue.\n\n'Now what do you say?' she asked proudly.\n\n'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' answered the daughter; and the mother wrung her hands and wept, as she knew that all her plans had failed.\n\nAt this moment the prince entered with his real wife. 'You both deserved death,' he said, 'and if it were left to me, you should have it. But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay till you die.'\n\nThen the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it, and it sailed away, and no more was heard of them.

'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.\n\n'That is our secret,' said the doves.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. 'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.\n\n'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.\n\nThen the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. 'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast.\r\r'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy.",

What is it you want?'\n\n'You must know,' said the fox, 'that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children. All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.'\n\n'But the cheeses may be all finished by now?'\n\n'If you were only to see the quantities of them!' laughed the fox. 'And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.'\n\n'Well, I will come. Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!'",

But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way;' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest. There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up.\n\nThen the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother. He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine.\n\nBut the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of. Just go your own way, will you?' Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home.",

For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.'\n\nSo the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows.

But the King came towards\nher and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My\neyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' When the dance was ended, she\ncurtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared,\nno one knew whither. The guards who were standing before the palace were\ncalled and questioned, but no one had seen her. When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she\nwas. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,\n'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots\nthrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he\nasked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King\ncould find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.\n\nAfter a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature\nbegged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He\nanswered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King\nthe bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little\nroom, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver\nas the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a\nKing's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her\nagain, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",

The Happy Hunter was very glad to have these two wonderful gems, the Jewel of the Flood Tide and the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, to take back with him, for he felt that they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time. After thanking his kind host again and again, he prepared to depart. The Sea King and the two Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, and all the inmates of the Palace, came out to say \"Good-by,\" and before the sound of the last farewell had died away the Happy Hunter passed out from under the gateway, past the well of happy memory standing in the shade of the great KATSURA trees on his way to the beach. The Skillful Fisher feigned forgiveness, for he could make no more excuses for sending his brother away again, but in his heart he was very angry and hated his brother more and more, till at last he could no longer bear the sight of him day after day, and planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him.\n\nOne day when the Happy Hunter was walking in the rice fields his brother followed him with a dagger. The Happy Hunter knew that his brother was following him to kill him, and he felt that now, in this hour of great danger, was the time to use the Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide and prove whether what the Sea King had told him was true or not.",

He consulted many doctors far and near,\nand took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally. But it\nwas all of no use.

Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand,\nand took the great lump from the old man's right cheek. Strange to say,\nit came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's\ntouch, and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished.",

Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for-a live monkey.",

In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said:\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?\"\n\n\"A very fine day,\" answered the monkey from the tree. \"I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it,\" answered the jelly fish.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you,\" said the monkey.\n\n\"By the bye,\" said the jelly fish, \"have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?\"\n\n\"I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!\" answered the monkey.\n\n\"Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description-it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,\" said the jelly fish.",

If I had only guessed of what you were in need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree.\"\n\n\"Have you left your liver behind you?\" asked the jelly fish.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the cunning monkey, \"during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you.

He skipped and\nleaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a\ncold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch\nto add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for\nthe cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he\nwalked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he\ncrossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. \"O,\nyou poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing\nterribly!\" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the\nstone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked\nhim how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his\nshirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite\nwhite and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. \"You\nfool,\" said the woman, \"do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it\nhad chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes\ncost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out\nin the field!\"--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his\njacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had\nraised itself from the ground on one side.",

So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. \"He will come back\nthis evening,\" said he. \"Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.\"\nBut in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited\nday by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his\nbrother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to\nkeep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And\nsuch was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his\nhomeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew\nhad been drowned.",

    "context": "On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; and when\nhe came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland\nschooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had\nnever yet seen. It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him\nto be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven\nof steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and\nhandsome as any Northlander might wish to have. The whole schooner was\nfilled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the\nhelm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for\nshe wore a crown and costly garments. Yet any one could see that she was\na human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk. In\nfact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever\nhad seen. The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; but with\nhis usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled\ndown his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid\nhimself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut. He soon\nnoticed that the whole room was alive with people.",

    "context": "There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and\nLucky Andrew. The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can\nquite make head or tail. He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with,\nand he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are,\nas a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with\nthese attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high\nspirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might\nbe, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star.\nWhen the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face\ntill the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a\nlucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his\nboat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him\nhanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and\nasked him how he felt, he would reply: \"O, quite well. I have been\nsaved. I surely am in luck!\" But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to\nremain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone;\nand he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point\nof the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a\nsea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still\nprovisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other\nthings. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. \"He will come back\nthis evening,\" said he. \"Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.\"\nBut in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited\nday by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his\nbrother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to\nkeep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And\nsuch was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his\nhomeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew\nhad been drowned.",

It was known as the Wart Hill\rof Hoy, and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a\rwonderful carbuncle, which, when it was found, would bestow on its\rfinder marvellous magic gifts--Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\rEverything, in fact, that a human being could desire.\r\rAnd the curious thing about this carbuncle was, that it was said that it\rcould be seen at certain times, if only the people who were looking for\rit were at the right spot at the right moment.\r\rNow Snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone,\rso, while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book\ror distilling medicines from his herbs, he was really keeping a keen\rlook-out during his wanderings, noting every tuft of grass or piece of\rrock under which it might be hidden. And at night, when everyone else\rwas asleep, he would creep out, with pickaxe and spade, to turn over the\rrocks or dig over the turf, in the hope of finding the long-sought-for\rtreasure underneath them.",
