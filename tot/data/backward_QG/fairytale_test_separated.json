And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen.\n\nThe father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy. 'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.\n\n'That is our secret,' said the doves.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. 'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.\n\n'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.\n\n'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.\n\nThen the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. 'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

The cook replied, 'Yes, you can go up,\nbut in half-an-hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes.' Then\nshe took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off\nher fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that\nher beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were\ncoming out of a black cloud. Then she opened the nut, and took out the\ndress as golden as the sun. And when she had done this, she went up to\nthe feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and\nthey thought she must be a King's daughter. But the King came towards\nher and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My\neyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' When the dance was ended, she\ncurtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared,\nno one knew whither. The guards who were standing before the palace were\ncalled and questioned, but no one had seen her. When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she\nwas. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,\n'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots\nthrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he\nasked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King\ncould find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.\n\nAfter a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature\nbegged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He\nanswered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King\nthe bread-soup that he likes so much.'

The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high\nspirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might\nbe, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star.\nWhen the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face\ntill the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a\nlucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his\nboat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him\nhanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and\nasked him how he felt, he would reply: \"O, quite well. I have been\nsaved. I surely am in luck!\" But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to\nremain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone;\nand he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point\nof the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a\nsea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still\nprovisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other\nthings. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. \"He will come back\nthis evening,\" said he. \"Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.\"\nBut in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited\nday by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his\nbrother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to\nkeep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And\nsuch was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his\nhomeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew\nhad been drowned.",
